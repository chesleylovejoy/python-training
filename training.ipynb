You\n    can put stuff in the bucket, take stuff out,\n    or replace it.\n\n Function = a piece of code either you or someone\n    else wrote that you can call to do stuff for\n    you. Functions take arguments, which may\n    change what they do or their output. We'll\n    look at some examples later.\n\n Data structure = a kind of container for data.\n    For example, the number 4, or the word \"frog\"\n    can just go directly into a 'regular' variable.\n    Your grocery list, though, you might want to save\n    as, wait for it, a list. Or if you want to\n    associate two things together, like people and\n    their phone numbers, you might want a map.\n\n  Control structure = how you make the code make\n    choices and/or do stuff over and over. Some\n    examples are if blocks (if A, do X, else do Y),\n    and loops (repeat this thing over and over until\n    I tell you to stop).\n\n=== PYTHON NOTES ===\n\nCode comments - any line or lines that start with #\n    don't have to be valid code. They're called\n    comments, and they can be English. You'll see\n    lots of these later on\n\nStructure - Python is spacing based? This is weird\n    but it means in control structures, to work\n    'inside' the control structure, you have to tab\n    over. Tabs (or consistent spaces) are how Python\n    knows how to read your code.\n\n=== JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS ===\n\nJupyter notebooks let you\nedit code and run it basically on the fly, only\nupdating stuff where you've changed the code.\n\nIt makes it really simple to see what your code is\ndoing, and really simple to run because we can do\nit directly in the browser.\n\nYou can use the play button to play the whole file,\nor one cell at a time. It's super user friendly.\n\nHitting play actually makes all the code in here\ndo stuff - that is, hitting play executes the code.\n\n=== SAFETY WARNING ===\n\nThis is a public notebook. Don't put your phone\nnumber or your darkest secrets in here.\n\n=== UNSAFETY WARNING ===\n\nYou literally cannot break this. The worst that\nhappens is your code errors out and then you\nget to google error messages (welcome to software\ndevelopment).\n\nAnytime you get to a TODO, that's a place where\nyou should write some code.\n\nYou just hit enter after the little TODO section\nand start typing. Just make sure you're putting\nyour code after the triple quotes (\" \" \") or\nyour code won't run.\n\n=== GOOGLE ===\n\nGoogle is your best friend.\n\nIf you get an error, if you want to know how to do\nsomething, google python + the thing and you'll\nbe good.\n\nIf you get an answer from stackoverflow.com, that's\nthe gold standard for programmers - try that result\nfirst.\n\nCongrats - you read the docs, which is half the battle.\n\"\"\";","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nLESSON 1: HELLO WORLD\n\nEvery programmer starts with hello world. You're\n    going to write a program that literally prints\n    the string \"Hello, world\"\n\nIn Python, a string is anything between two\n     single or double quotes. Like:\n     \"frog\"\n     'frog'\n     \"Was that a frog\"\n     'There were 800 frogs'\n\nTo print something, you just call the built in\n    function print. It takes one argument, which\n    is the string you want to print.\n\nHere's an example:\nprint('An example')\n\nTODO 1: write the code to print Hello, world.\n    Once you do that and hit play, you should\n    see Hello, world print out on the screen.\n\"\"\";\n\n\n# Write your code in this space:\n\n\n\n\n\n# end code","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nLESSON 2: USING VARIABLES\n\nThe first step in using a variable is to declare it.\n\nThat's where you say, here's my variable, here's\nwhat I want to put in it for now.\n\nRemember a variable is just a bucket and we can\nput anything in it (in Python - not so true in\nother languages).\n\nHere's an example.
