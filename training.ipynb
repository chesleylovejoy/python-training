    "    It's relatively easy to get started with because\n",

    "    It also has dynamic typing, which means we\n",

    " Function = a piece of code either you or someone\n",
    "    else wrote that you can call to do stuff for\n",

    "    look at some examples later.\n",
    "\n",
    " Data structure = a kind of container for data.\n",
    "    For example, the number 4, or the word \"frog\"\n",
    "    can just go directly into a 'regular' variable.\n",
    "    Your grocery list, though, you might want to save\n",
    "    as, wait for it, a list. Or if you want to\n",

    "  Control structure = how you make the code make\n",
    "    choices and/or do stuff over and over. Some\n",
